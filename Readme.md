## Prerequisites

Have installed TexWorks, or Texmake and MikTex

## How to use

0. fill in the excel data that you want to use.
1. Click the button on page "Course"
2. doubleclick `buildme.vbs`

That will automatically build the pdf and generate a list of taskwarrior commands that allow you to instantly enter all the tasks of this planning into your agenda.

## TODO

Fix `CommandScripts.vbs` so that users don't have to use python.

Automate running `buildme.vbs` when excel is done.
